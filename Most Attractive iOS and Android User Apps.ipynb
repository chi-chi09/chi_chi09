    "We concluded that creating a \"Reference\" and a \"Health & Fitness\" Genere apps will be the most attractive and profitable to produce. It is a great balance of having alot of users and not being saturated. We can produce an app that brings motivation quotes or favorite lines from different books or bible passages. As well as  another genre app in the Health & Fitness that supplies bodyweight workouts for users during this time.\n",

    "We concluded that creating a \"Reference\" and a \"Health & Fitness\" Genere apps will be the most attractive and profitable to produce. It is a great balance of having alot of users and not being saturated. We can produce an app that brings motivation quotes or favorite lines from different books or bible passages. As well as  another genre app in the Health & Fitness that supplies bodyweight workouts for users during this time."
